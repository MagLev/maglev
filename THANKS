Many thanks to the MagLev Alpha testers who have contributed code and design
ideas, reported and sometimes fixed bugs, and helped in many other ways,
including:

- Markus Roberts, for lots of feedback, bugfixes, and porting irb and zaml
  to MagLev.

  under MagLev, and his valuable feedback and bugfixes while suffering
  through earliest Alphas
- Danie Roux and Otto Behrens, for providing rake scripts to manage multiple
  MagLev systems on a single computer.

- Daniel Starling for generalizing the KD-Tree example to n dimensions and adding

  mkmf.rb working and other help with MagLev C extensions.
- Jesse Cooke for adding MagLev support to ruby-build - https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build
