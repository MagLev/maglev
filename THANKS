Many thanks to the MagLev Alpha testers who have contributed code and design
ideas, reported and sometimes fixed bugs, and helped in many other ways,
including:

- Markus Roberts, for lots of feedback, bugfixes, and porting irb and zaml
  to MagLev.
- Michael Latta, for getting the MySQL driver and some of Rails working 
  under MagLev, and his valuable feedback and bugfixes while suffering
  through earliest Alphas
- Danie Roux and Otto Behrens, for providing rake scripts to manage multiple
  MagLev systems on a single computer.
- Ryan Davis for his implementation of ruby_parser2.0.2, which was the
  starting point for the parser implemented in the MagRp module.

- Wayne Seguin for adding MagLev support to RVM - http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/
- Daniel Starling for generalizing the KD-Tree example to n dimensions and adding

  mkmf.rb working and other help with MagLev C extensions.
- Jesse Cooke for adding MagLev support to ruby-build - https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build
  and exposing RCQueue, along with starting the use of MSpec for functionality like the Reduced Conflict classes.
