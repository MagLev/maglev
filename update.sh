#
# Name - update.sh
#
# Purpose - Automatically update to a new version of GemStone
#           in an existing git repository cloned from MagLev on github.
#           Be both verbose and idempotent, so we can easily diagnose
#           any problems.
#
# $Id:$
#
# Description:
#    Updates GemStone to a version corresponsing to $MAGLEV_HOME/version.txt
#    Safe to run multiple times. Only saves one prior backup repository though.
#
# Actions:
#    Download the GemStone archive into the parent directory
#    Uncompress the GemStone archive in the parent directory
#    Update the gemstone link to point to the new GemStone
#    Backup any existing 'maglev' repository
#    Wipeout any previous 'maglev' configuration file
#    Create a new default repository called 'maglev'
#    Generate the MagLev HTML documentation
#    Print build version information
#    Remind user to setup environment variables
