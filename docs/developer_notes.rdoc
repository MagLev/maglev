= Notes on Developing MagLev Applications

This file contains random insights into developing MagLev applications.

== Bundler

One thing to be careful of, is running bundler under maglev, and then
accidentally using MRI rake.  You can get a lot of messages like:

  $ rake -T
  (in /Users/pmclain/tmp/myapp)
  Could not find tzinfo-0.3.24 in any of the sources
  Try running `bundle install`.

In this example, tzinfo-0.3.24 is installed as a Maglev gem, but not
installed in MRI.  The Gemfile.lock was generated by Maglev bundler, but
when you run MRI rake, MRI can't find the appropriate tzinfo gem.  Running
$MAGLEV_HOME/bin/rake -T works fine.

== File View vs Repository View

=== The Problem
One thing that will probably bite you at one time or another, is that
you'll be developing an application, commit some code, then refactor it and
re-commit, but you'll get a mysterious bug:

  Deleting a method from your file does not delete it from the repository!

E.g.,

  Maglev.persistent do

    class Tag

      attr_reader :name

      def initialize(name)
         @name = name
      end

      # Other stuff...
    end

  end
  Maglev.commit_transaction

  t = Tag.new("fred")

You run the code to test it and it works.  Now you decide to refactor (you
don't want to name your tags afterall), so you edit <tt>tag.rb</tt> and
delete the intialize method and the reader:

  Maglev.persistent do

    class Tag
      # Other stuff...
    end

  end
  Maglev.commit_transaction

  t = Tag.new

You re-run the code, but you get the following error:

  $ maglev-ruby tag.rb
  -- RubyFile>>load  : loading /Users/pmclain/GemStone/dev/tag.rb
  error , too few arguments,
            during /Users/pmclain/GemStone/dev/tag.rb
  -----------------------------------------------------
  GemStone: Error         Nonfatal
  Error, 'too few arguments'
  Error Category: 231169 [GemStone] Number: 2023 Arg Count: 1 Context : 148473601
  Arg 1: [69411841 sz:17 cls: 74753 String] too few arguments

While the code in <tt>tag.rb</tt> is "correct", MagLev still has the old
definition of <tt>Tag#initialize</tt> in the repository, so it is expecting
one parameter, and the new code doesn't pass any parameters to +new+.

=== The Solution

Currently, the only thing to do is to reset the repository back to scratch:

  $ cd $MAGLEV_HOME
  $ rake maglev:reload
  $ rake maglev:start

Now, the second version of the file is "in-synch" with the state of the
repository, and the code runs fine.

== Performance Profiling

MagLev provides a Gprof-like profiling utility to analyze the performance
of your application.  To profile some code, simply wrap it in a block and
pass it to <tt>Maglev::Gprof.monitor</tt>:

  profile_results = Maglev::Gprof.monitor do
    # Code to profile goes here...
  end

  puts profile_results

The return value of <tt>Maglev::Gprof.monitor</tt> is a <tt>String</tt>
with formatted results.

== Miscellaneous

* Be careful of running applications on a stone that has a different
  app/framework persisted on it.  E.g., if you've persisted a Sinatra app
  on your maglev stone, then running a Rails app (even non-persisted) may
  be affected.  Sinatra will decorate kernel classes (i.e., Object) with
  methods that may confuse the Rails app.  It is probably best, even in
  development, to create a separate stone for each application that you
  persist, that way you won't accidentally confuse other apps.  This is
  probably mostly a concern with frameworks.  You probably won't run into
  many problems running several Sinatra apps on a stone with persisted
  Sinatra apps.  But you probably shouldn't mix persisted Sinatra apps with
  Rails apps etc.
