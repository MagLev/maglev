This directory contains a copy of Brian Ford's refactoring of the
Ruby Benchmark Suite project as used by the Rubinius project. We made
a one line change to bench.rb to ensure it runs in MagLev as well as
other Ruby implementations.

The primary Ruby Benchmark Suite project is at:
  http://github.com/acangiano/ruby-benchmark-suite/

Subdirectories:
  rbs   - contains the benchmarks themselves
  utils - contains the infrastructure necessary to run the benchmarks

see $MAGLEV_HOME/benchmark/utils/README for more detail.

Benchmarks are run using rake. Type "rake -T bench" to see options.

Examples:
  rake bench
  rake bench:file FILE=benchmark/rbs/core-features/bm_app_tak.rb
  rake bench:dir DIR=benchmark/rbs/core-features
  rake bench:to_csv
