# The Maglev module contains MagLev specific APIs.  Most MagLev specific
# features are rooted under this module, but a few features are placed
# elsewhere (e.g., in +Module+).
#
# Note that eigenclasses (singleton classes) are always marked persistable
# and are always marked to allow instances to be persisted.  Eigenclasses
# are persisted when their corresponding Ruby object is persisted (by
# reachability).

  # and at VM startup.

  # Executes the block with the current thread in transient mode, which
  # affects the following operations:
  #
  # 1. All newly defined modules and classes will be marked as transient,
  #    and their names will be registered under the transient slot of the
  #    appropriate namespace (i.e., the constants that refer to the new
  #    classes will not be written to the repository during a
  #    <tt>Maglev.commit_transaction</tt>).
  #
  # 2. All assignments to constants will happen in the transient namespace,
  #    even for persistent modules and classes.
  #
  # 3. All method definitions in re-opened classes and modules will be
  #    placed into the transient dictionaries and not be available for
  #    persistence (but see <tt>Module#maglev_persistable=</tt>).
  #
  # 4. All methods defined via <tt>Object#extend</tt> or
  #    <tt>Module#include</tt> will be done transiently, even if the target
  #    class or module is marked persistable.
  #
  # If the thread is already in transient mode, the block is executed and
  # the thread remains in transient mode (i.e., a no-op).
  #
  # == Example
  #
  # Suppose there already exist a persistent module named +Persistent+, and
  # a transient module named +Transient+.  We then run the following code:
  #
  #   Maglev.transient do
  #
  #     module Persistent   # a previously defined, persistent module
  #       class C           # A brand new class
  #         A_CONST = 42
  #         def foo
  #         end
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     Maglev::PERSISTENT_ROOT['foo'] = Persistent::C
  #
  #     Persistent::X = 42
  #     Transient::X  = 42
  #
  #   end
  #
  #   Maglev.commit_transaction
  #
  # After the code runs, the following statements hold:
  #
  # 1. Module +Persistent+ is still persisted in the repository, and module
  #    +Transient+ is still local to this VM.
  #
  # 2. <tt>Persistent::C</tt> is a constant in <tt>Persistent</tt>'s transient
  #    namespace, so will not have been written to the repository.  The
  #    current VM will still see <tt>Persistent::C</tt>.
  #
  # 3. <tt>Persistent::C</tt> is a class that is itself not persistable,
  #    nor are its instances persistable.
  #
  # 4. All methods and constants in <tt>Persistent::C</tt>,
  #    (<tt>Persistent::C::A_CONST</tt> and <tt>Persistent::C#foo</tt> will
  #    be lost (as will +C+) when the VM shuts down.
  #
  # 5. <tt>Maglev::PERSISTENT_ROOT['foo'] = Persistent::C</tt> will raise an
  #    exception at commit time (since +C+ is not persistable).
  #
  # 6. For <tt>Transient::X = 42</tt>, both the constant and its value are
  #    visible to the current VM, but not saved in the repository.
  #
  # 7. For <tt>Persistent::X = 42</tt>, both the constant +X+ and its
  #    current value (42) are visible to the current VM.  The repository
  #    will see the constant <tt>Persistent::X</tt> only if it was in the
  #    repository prior to the commit, and if it was, the repository will
  #    see the previous value.
  #
  # Calls to +transient+ may be nested inside other calls to +transient+
  # and calls to +persistent+.

  # Returns the value of executing the block.

  # Executes the block with the current thread in persistent mode, which

  #    appropriate namespace (i.e., if the parent namespace is persistent,
  #    then the constant will be staged for persistence; if the parent
  #    namespace is transient, the constant reference will not be visible
  #    to the persistent store).
  #
  # 2. For new class definitions, if the <tt>persistable_instances</tt>
  #    flag is set to +true+, then the VM will also mark the class so that
  #    instances of that class may also be persisted.  If the flag is
  #    +false+, then the class, but not its instances, will be persistable
  #    (this allows you to load and commit library code for performance).
  #
  # 3. All assignments to constants in persistent classes and modules will
  #    be seen by the repository at the next
  #    <tt>Maglev.commit_transaction</tt>.  Any assignment to constants in
  #    transient classes and modules will be visible in the current VM, but
  #    will not be saved to the repository.
  #
  # 4. All method definitions in re-opened persistent classes and modules
  #    will be placed into both the transient and persistent method
  #    dictionaries and will be available for persistence.  It does not
  #    matter how the method is defined (e.g., <tt>define_method</tt>,
  #    <tt>module_eval</tt>, etc.).
  #
  #    All method definitions in re-opened transient classes and modules
  #    will be available only to the current VM and will not be persisted
  #    (i.e., defining a method on a transient class during persistent mode
  #    does not change the class to be persistent).
  #
  # 5. All methods defined via <tt>Object#extend</tt> or
  #    <tt>Module#include</tt> will be done persistently.
  #
  # 6. When the persistent_mode transitions from true to false,
  #    the current transient $LOAD_PATH (i.e. $: )  is copied
  #    to persistent state.  See also discussion of $LOADED_FEATURES below.
  #    At session startup, the transient $LOAD_PATH is initialized with
  #    a copy of the persistent $LOAD_PATH .
  #
  # If the current thread is already in persistent mode, the block is
  # executed and the thread remains in persistent mode (i.e., a no-op).
  #
  # == Example
  #
  # Suppose there already exist a persistent module named +Persistent+, and
