module Maglev
  # Class Maglev::System is identically Smalltalk System
  #
  # Maglev::System provides access to many transaction and locking
  # facilities in MagLev.  Among the facilities are:
  # <ul>
  #  <li>Transaction management (commit, abort etc.)</li>
  #  <li>Persistent Shared Counters</li>
  #  <li>Object Locks</li>
  #  <li>Access system counters (metrics)</li>
  #  <li>Miscellaneous other support</li>
  # </ul>
  #
  # == Persistent Shared Counters
  #
  # Maglev::System maintins a set of persistent shared counters.
  #
  # Persistent shared counters provide a means for multiple sessions to
  # share common integer values.  There are 128 persistent shared counters,
  # numbered from 1 to 128. The index of the first counter is 1.
  #
  # Each update to a persistent shared counter causes a roundtrip to the
  # stone process.  However reading the value of a counter is handled by
  # the gem (and its page server, if any) and does not cause a roundtrip to
  # the stone.
  #
  # Persistent shared counters are globally visible to all sessions on all
  # shared page caches.
  #
  # Persistent shared counters hold 64 bit values and may be set to any
  # signed 64 bit integer value.  No limit checks are done when
  # incrementing or decrementing a counter.  Attempts to
  # increment/decrement the counter above/below the minimum/maximum value
  # of a signed 64-bit integer will cause the counter to 'roll over'.
  #
  # Persistent shared counters are independent of database transactions.
  # Updates to counters are visible immediately and aborts have no effect
  # on them.
  #
  # The values of all persistent shared counters are written to the primary
  # database extent at checkpoint time.  Updates between checkpoints are
  # written to the transaction log by the stone.  Therefore the state of
  # the persistent shared counters is recoverable after a crash, restore
  # from backup, and restore from transaction logs.
  #
  # Persistent shared counter performance is affected by the stone
  # configuration option STN_COMMITS_ASYNC.  Setting this option to TRUE
  # will result in faster update performance because the stone will respond
  # to update requests after the tranlog write has been queued but before
  # it completes.  Operating in this mode leaves a small chance of losing
  # data should the stone or host machine crash after the tranlog write was
  # queued but before it completes.  If this value is set to FALSE, the
  # stone will only respond to update requests after the tranlog write has
  # completed."
  #
  # == Object Locks
  #
  # MagLev allows setting and releasing locks on objects.  The system
  # supports read locks and write locks. A session may hold only one kind
  # of lock on an object at a time.  Holding locks prevents transactions
  # whose activities would conflict with your own from committing changes
  # to the repository.  MagLev permits you to request any kind of lock,
  # regardless of your transaction mode or whether you are in a
  # transaction.
  #
  # If you request a lock on an object and another session already holds a
  # conflicting lock on it, then MagLev denies your request; MagLev
  # does not automatically wait for locks to become available.
  #
  # It is possible that you may never succeed in acquiring a lock, no
  # matter how long you wait. Furthermore, because GemStone does not
  # automatically wait for locks, it does not attempt deadlock
  # detection. It is your responsibility to limit the attempts to acquire
  # locks in some way.
  #
  # Locks work across sessions (i.e., locking an object in one VM, locks it
  # in all VMs connected to the same repository).
  #
  # For more information on locks, see the GemStone Programming Guide.
  #
  # === Read Locks
  #
  # Holding a read lock on an object means that you can use the object’s
  # value, and then commit without fear that some other transaction has
  # committed a new value for that object during your transaction. Another
  # way of saying this is that holding a read lock on an object guarantees
  # that other sessions cannot
  # * acquire a write lock on the object, or
  # * commit if they have written the object.
  #
  # === Write Locks
  #
  # Holding a write lock on an object guarantees that you can write the
  # object and commit. That is, it ensures that you won’t find that someone
  # else has prevented you from committing by writing the object and
  # committing it before you, while your transaction was in progress.
  # Another way of looking at this is that holding a write lock on an
  # object guarantees that other sessions cannot:
  # * acquire either a read or write lock on the object, or
  # * commit if they have written the object.
  #
  # Write locks differ from read locks in that only one session can hold a
  # write lock on an object. In fact, if a session holds a write lock on an
  # object, then no other session can hold any kind of lock on the
  # object. This prevents another session from receiving the assurance
  # implied by a read lock: that the value of the object it sees in its
  # view will not be out of date when it attempts to commit a transaction.
  #
  # === Non Lockable Objects
  #
  # MagLev does not allow you to lock instances of +Fixnum+, +Float+,
  # +TrueClass+, +FalseClass+ or nil (i.e., instances of Smalltalk classes
  # +SmallInteger+, +Boolean+, +SmallDouble+ or nil). Trying to lock these
  # special objects is meaningless.
  #
  # === Example
  #
  # In one MagLev VM, run the following code:
  #
  #     Maglev::System.write_lock Maglev::PERSISTENT_ROOT
  #     puts "grabed lock...sleeping..."
  #     sleep 10
  #
  #     Maglev::System.remove_locks_for_session
  #     puts "released locks...sleeping..."
  #     sleep 10
  #
  # In another MagLev VM, run the following code:
  #
  #     while true
  #       begin
  #         puts "Attempting to grab lock..."
  #         Maglev::System.write_lock Maglev::PERSISTENT_ROOT
  #         puts "Got the lock!"
  #         sleep 1
  #         Maglev::System.remove_lock Maglev::PERSISTENT_ROOT
  #       rescue LockError
  #         puts "Got a lock error; sleep a while"
  #         sleep 1
  #         redo
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # === Not Yet Supported
  #
  # The underlying GemStone system supports many lock related methods, not
  # all of them have been exposed to MagLev.  Among these features are:
  # * Efficient locking of collections
  # * Upgrading locks
  # * Release Lock Sets (see "Releasing Locks Upon Aborting or Committing"
  #   in the GemStone Programming Manual).
  # * Inquiring about locks and lock owners.
  # * Application Write Locks

    # Attempts to update the persistent state of the Repository to include
    # changes made by this transaction.
    #
    # If the commit operation succeeds, then this method returns +true+,
    # and the current transaction's changes, if any, become a part of the
    # persistent Repository.  After the repository update, the session
    # exits the current transaction.  If the transaction mode is
    # <tt>:autoBegin</tt>, then the session enters a new transaction.  If
    # the transaction mode is <tt>:manualBegin</tt>, then the session
    # remains outside of a transaction.
    #
    # If conflicts prevent the repository update, then this method returns
    # +false+.  Call the <tt>transactionConflicts</tt> (TBD: not
    # implemented in ruby yet) method to determine the nature of the
    # conflicts.  If the session is outside of a transaction, then this
    # method raises the error <tt>#rtErrPrimOutsideTrans</tt>.
    #
    # This method also updates the session's view of GemStone.  If the
    # commit operation succeeds, then all objects in the session's view are
    # consistent with the current state of GemStone.  If the commit fails,
    # then this method retains all the changes that were made to objects
    # within the current transaction.  However, commits made by other
    # sessions are visible to the extent that changes in this transaction
    # do not conflict with them.
