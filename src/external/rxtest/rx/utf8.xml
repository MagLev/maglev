<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>UBL by the Numbers</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Via Jon Bosak, a pointer to
<a href="http://www.xmlconference.org/xmlusa/2004/slides/brun&amp;nielsen/Handling%201200%20Goverment%20Forms%20in%20XML%20Schema.ppt">this
XML 2004 presentation</a> (PowerPoint, sigh), about the Danish Government’s
deployment of a bunch of XML technologies including UBL.  
Check out slides 4 &amp; 5: they estimate the annual savings achievable from
invoicing in UBL at somewhere between €100M and €160M.
I may be out of step with the crowd but it seems
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/14/UBL10">painfully obvious</a> to me that
UBL is going to be huge and I don’t understand why more technology vendors
(including my employer) aren’t refocusing their e-business strategy around
it.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<p>Via the Reg, I see NCD

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

</head>
<body>
<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to

cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.
<i>Item</i>: Joel Spolsky’s must-read
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html">Camels

highly-compressed wisdom on the subject.

<i>Item:</i> Finally, James Governor’s
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/000378.html">eloquent
bafflement</a> at the notion that Sun’s per-employee pricing is
“confusing”.</p> 
<img src="1174.jpg" alt="African figures, flower arrangement and swagger stick" />
<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<title>Wintry</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<p>It’s nice to see that Google has
<a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">taken
up the cudgels</a> against comment spam in what seems like an effective way.
I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">pathetic losers</a>, 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">ineffectual morons</a>,
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">abusive predators</a>,
and probably
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">deserve to be in
jail</a>.
There, wasn’t that fun?
Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or

can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<img src="Hello-Z.png" alt="Safari + Tomcat + Servlets + Jython + Zeppelin" />
<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and
I can quite switching back and forth between the IDE and Emacs.</p>

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>

<p>The picture tells the story.</p>
<img src="Hello-Z.png" alt="Safari + Tomcat + Servlets + Jython + Zeppelin" />
<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/timf/20050109#solaris_on_the_desktop">this</a>]</i>,
and if I do, this persistent stupidity about keystrokes will probably be the #1
cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.
<i>Item</i>: Joel Spolsky’s must-read
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html">Camels
and Rubber Duckies</a>, a touch over-long perhaps but stuffed with
highly-compressed wisdom on the subject.
<i>Item:</i> We ship Solaris 10 for free, with the expectation of huge
financial upside.

<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmc/20040828#the_economics_of_software">The
Economics of Software</a>; if you don’t know what “The FYO Point” is, read
this one.
<i>Item:</i> Finally, James Governor’s
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/000378.html">eloquent
bafflement</a> at the notion that Sun’s per-employee pricing is
“confusing”.</p> 
<img src="1174.jpg" alt="African figures, flower arrangement and swagger stick" />
<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<title>Wintry</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>
<p><i>[Disclosure: O’Reilly sends me notifications of new releases, and when
I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures

thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on

I think my

<p>Or am I missing something obvious?

<p>It’s nice to see that Google has
<a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">taken
up the cudgels</a> against comment spam in what seems like an effective way.
I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>

<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:

IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from

<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for

<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,

The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using

McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/timf/20050109#solaris_on_the_desktop">this</a>]</i>,
and if I do, this persistent stupidity about keystrokes will probably be the #1
cause.

Access”, thank you, I know about it, compared to the state of the art on

<p>The data is from 2004.
Growth from 121 thousand to 258 thousand over the course of a year is not too
bad, but averaged out, it represents 1.6568%/week.
Which is not that great.
The variation is more than a little weird.</p>

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html">Camels
and Rubber Duckies</a>, a touch over-long perhaps but stuffed with
highly-compressed wisdom on the subject.

financial upside.

<i>Item:</i> Finally, James Governor’s
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/000378.html">eloquent
bafflement</a> at the notion that Sun’s per-employee pricing is
“confusing”.</p> 
<img src="1174.jpg" alt="African figures, flower arrangement and swagger stick" />
<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<title>Wintry</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<title>Two Licenses</title>

<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,

Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by

I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>The picture tells the story.</p>
<img src="Hello-Z.png" alt="Safari + Tomcat + Servlets + Jython + Zeppelin" />
<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and
I can quite switching back and forth between the IDE and Emacs.</p>

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

I may be out of step with the crowd but it seems

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/timf/20050109#solaris_on_the_desktop">this</a>]</i>,
and if I do, this persistent stupidity about keystrokes will probably be the #1
cause.
<i>[To all the helpful people who’ve written me about OS X’s “Full Keyboard
Access”, thank you, I know about it, compared to the state of the art on
Windows and Linux it’s a toy.]</i></p>

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<i>Item:</i> Finally, James Governor’s
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/000378.html">eloquent
bafflement</a> at the notion that Sun’s per-employee pricing is
“confusing”.</p> 
<img src="1174.jpg" alt="African figures, flower arrangement and swagger stick" />
<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<title>Wintry</title>

<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

address; wouldn’t be nice if some capable law-enforcement organization found
whoever it is that’s doing it and THREW THEIR ASS IN JAIL?</p>
<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or

David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<img src="Hello-Z.png" alt="Safari + Tomcat + Servlets + Jython + Zeppelin" />
<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<i>Item:</i> Finally, James Governor’s
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/000378.html">eloquent
bafflement</a> at the notion that Sun’s per-employee pricing is
“confusing”.</p> 
<img src="1174.jpg" alt="African figures, flower arrangement and swagger stick" />
<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<title>Wintry</title>

<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

way.</p>
<p>For a while this morning, it seemed to have stopped. 
But as of 11:30 AM Pacific time, they’re back.
This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP
address; wouldn’t be nice if some capable law-enforcement organization found
whoever it is that’s doing it and THREW THEIR ASS IN JAIL?</p>
<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>

<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

blogs as a matter of course.
Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an
insider’s feel for what this whole Solaris thing is <em>really</em> about can
bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent

<p>Over at the ZD BTL space, David Berlind
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using

McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to

and if I do, this persistent stupidity about keystrokes will probably be the #1
cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<i>Item:</i> Finally, James Governor’s
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/000378.html">eloquent
bafflement</a> at the notion that Sun’s per-employee pricing is
“confusing”.</p> 
<img src="1174.jpg" alt="African figures, flower arrangement and swagger stick" />
<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<p>For a while this morning, it seemed to have stopped. 
But as of 11:30 AM Pacific time, they’re back.
This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP
address; wouldn’t be nice if some capable law-enforcement organization found
whoever it is that’s doing it and THREW THEIR ASS IN JAIL?</p>
<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

<p>Hey, the
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/">OpenSolaris</a> web site is up!
You cannot possibly imagine how much work this has taken, and there’s still
lots to do.
I’m happy to see that this kind of major technology push comes with a list of
blogs as a matter of course.
Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an
insider’s feel for what this whole Solaris thing is <em>really</em> about can
bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent

<p>Over at the ZD BTL space, David Berlind
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using

McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/timf/20050109#solaris_on_the_desktop">this</a>]</i>,
and if I do, this persistent stupidity about keystrokes will probably be the #1
cause.

Access”, thank you, I know about it, compared to the state of the art on
Windows and Linux it’s a toy.]</i></p>

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<i>Item:</i> Finally, James Governor’s
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/000378.html">eloquent
bafflement</a> at the notion that Sun’s per-employee pricing is
“confusing”.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>

<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>

<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

<p>Hey, the

You cannot possibly imagine how much work this has taken, and there’s still
lots to do.
I’m happy to see that this kind of major technology push comes with a list of
blogs as a matter of course.
Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an
insider’s feel for what this whole Solaris thing is <em>really</em> about can
bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent

<p>Over at the ZD BTL space, David Berlind
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using

McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<title>TechWikiDoc</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to

cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

bafflement</a> at the notion that Sun’s per-employee pricing is
“confusing”.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>

<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,

5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>

ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>

<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and

three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>

<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using

McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to

cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

bafflement</a> at the notion that Sun’s per-employee pricing is
“confusing”.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using

McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<title>Bye, NCD</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Via the Reg, I see NCD
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/13/ncd_memo/">is</a> going 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to

cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

bafflement</a> at the notion that Sun’s per-employee pricing is
“confusing”.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<p>For a while this morning, it seemed to have stopped. 
But as of 11:30 AM Pacific time, they’re back.
This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP
address; wouldn’t be nice if some capable law-enforcement organization found
whoever it is that’s doing it and THREW THEIR ASS IN JAIL?</p>
<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<p>It’s nice to see that Google has
<a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">taken
up the cudgels</a> against comment spam in what seems like an effective way.
I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">pathetic losers</a>, 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">ineffectual morons</a>,

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">deserve to be in

There, wasn’t that fun?
Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Atom Format: Final Flurry</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Atom Data format (whose most recent draft spec is available in 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-format-04.txt">ASCII</a> and
<a href="http://www.atompub.org/2005/01/10/draft-ietf-atompub-format-04.html">HTML</a>)
is about ready to move on to its next phase, consideration by the whole IETF.
We’ve ganged up 
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/AtomPubIssuesList">the last 15
open issues</a> for the Working Group’s final 
yes-or-no.
The discussion is <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/">here</a>; if you

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

<p>Hey, the

You cannot possibly imagine how much work this has taken, and there’s still
lots to do.
I’m happy to see that this kind of major technology push comes with a list of
blogs as a matter of course.
Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an
insider’s feel for what this whole Solaris thing is <em>really</em> about can
bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmc/20050125#solaris_10_revealed">Solaris 10

<p>Over at the ZD BTL space, David Berlind
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a
href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050124080334639">trying</a>

<p>The picture tells the story.</p>
<img src="Hello-Z.png" alt="Safari + Tomcat + Servlets + Jython + Zeppelin" />
<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and
I can quite switching back and forth between the IDE and Emacs.</p>

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

deployment of a bunch of XML technologies including UBL.  
Check out slides 4 &amp; 5: they estimate the annual savings achievable from
invoicing in UBL at somewhere between €100M and €160M.
I may be out of step with the crowd but it seems

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>

<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)

draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and

There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the

<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>

you have to write a program to generate it.

<title>Bye, NCD</title>

<body>
<p>Via the Reg, I see NCD
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/13/ncd_memo/">is</a> going 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to

cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

“confusing”.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>

<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>
<p><i>[Disclosure: O’Reilly sends me notifications of new releases, and when
I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<p>For a while this morning, it seemed to have stopped. 
But as of 11:30 AM Pacific time, they’re back.
This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP
address; wouldn’t be nice if some capable law-enforcement organization found
whoever it is that’s doing it and THREW THEIR ASS IN JAIL?</p>
<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<p>It’s nice to see that Google has
<a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">taken
up the cudgels</a> against comment spam in what seems like an effective way.
I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">pathetic losers</a>, 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">ineffectual morons</a>,
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">abusive predators</a>,
and probably
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">deserve to be in
jail</a>.
There, wasn’t that fun?
Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

You cannot possibly imagine how much work this has taken, and there’s still

blogs as a matter of course.
Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an
insider’s feel for what this whole Solaris thing is <em>really</em> about can
bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent

<p>Over at the ZD BTL space, David Berlind
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<img src="Hello-Z.png" alt="Safari + Tomcat + Servlets + Jython + Zeppelin" />
<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and
I can quite switching back and forth between the IDE and Emacs.</p>

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<title>Bye, NCD</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Via the Reg, I see NCD
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/13/ncd_memo/">is</a> going 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe

cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.

<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the

The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>

<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>

<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>

<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>
<p><i>[Disclosure: O’Reilly sends me notifications of new releases, and when
I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<p>For a while this morning, it seemed to have stopped. 
But as of 11:30 AM Pacific time, they’re back.
This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP
address; wouldn’t be nice if some capable law-enforcement organization found
whoever it is that’s doing it and THREW THEIR ASS IN JAIL?</p>
<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<p>It’s nice to see that Google has
<a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">taken
up the cudgels</a> against comment spam in what seems like an effective way.
I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">pathetic losers</a>, 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">ineffectual morons</a>,

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">deserve to be in

There, wasn’t that fun?
Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>

<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an

bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent

<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and
I can quite switching back and forth between the IDE and Emacs.</p>

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<body>
<p>This is the
<a href="http://www.xtech-conference.org">big European summer XML event</a>;
the
<a href="http://www.xtech-conference.org/2005/call.asp">call for papers</a> is
closing in a couple days.  Edd Dumbill, the chair, 
tells me that the submissions are excellent on the server side but there’s
room on the
<a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2004/12/20-browsers/read">client
side</a>, so all you XULoids and .NET-hacks and SVGers and XFormlings, get with
it.  
Lauren and I are going to try to go (haven’t been to Amsterdam in ages); I’m
particularly interested by the
<a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2005/01/05-xtech-open-data/read">Open
Data track</a>, which sounds like something new in the world.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<title>Bye, NCD</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Via the Reg, I see NCD
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/13/ncd_memo/">is</a> going 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<body>
<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/timf/20050109#solaris_on_the_desktop">this</a>]</i>,
and if I do, this persistent stupidity about keystrokes will probably be the #1
cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>
<p><i>[Disclosure: O’Reilly sends me notifications of new releases, and when
I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<p>For a while this morning, it seemed to have stopped. 
But as of 11:30 AM Pacific time, they’re back.
This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP
address; wouldn’t be nice if some capable law-enforcement organization found
whoever it is that’s doing it and THREW THEIR ASS IN JAIL?</p>
<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">taken
up the cudgels</a> against comment spam in what seems like an effective way.
I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">pathetic losers</a>, 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">ineffectual morons</a>,

and probably
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">deserve to be in

There, wasn’t that fun?
Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

<p>Hey, the

You cannot possibly imagine how much work this has taken, and there’s still
lots to do.
I’m happy to see that this kind of major technology push comes with a list of
blogs as a matter of course.
Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an
insider’s feel for what this whole Solaris thing is <em>really</em> about can
bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmc/20050125#solaris_10_revealed">Solaris 10

<p>Over at the ZD BTL space, David Berlind
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>The picture tells the story.</p>
<img src="Hello-Z.png" alt="Safari + Tomcat + Servlets + Jython + Zeppelin" />
<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and
I can quite switching back and forth between the IDE and Emacs.</p>

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

I may be out of step with the crowd but it seems

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

enough to do

<p>This is the

the

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<title>Bye, NCD</title>

<body>
<p>Via the Reg, I see NCD
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/13/ncd_memo/">is</a> going 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<body>
<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/timf/20050109#solaris_on_the_desktop">this</a>]</i>,
and if I do, this persistent stupidity about keystrokes will probably be the #1
cause.

Access”, thank you, I know about it, compared to the state of the art on
Windows and Linux it’s a toy.]</i></p>

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP

<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">taken
up the cudgels</a> against comment spam in what seems like an effective way.
I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">pathetic losers</a>,

and probably
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">deserve to be in

There, wasn’t that fun?
Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working.

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,

<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an

bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go

<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<img src="Hello-Z.png" alt="Safari + Tomcat + Servlets + Jython + Zeppelin" />
<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/timf/20050109#solaris_on_the_desktop">this</a>]</i>,
and if I do, this persistent stupidity about keystrokes will probably be the #1
cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>

<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP

<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">pathetic losers</a>,

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">deserve to be in

There, wasn’t that fun?
Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working.

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

You cannot possibly imagine how much work this has taken, and there’s still

I’m happy to see that this kind of major technology push comes with a list of
blogs as a matter of course.
Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an
insider’s feel for what this whole Solaris thing is <em>really</em> about can
bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent

<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a
href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050124080334639">trying</a>

<img src="Hello-Z.png" alt="Safari + Tomcat + Servlets + Jython + Zeppelin" />
<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and
I can quite switching back and forth between the IDE and Emacs.</p>

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

I may be out of step with the crowd but it seems

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.

I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our

original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for

poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/timf/20050109#solaris_on_the_desktop">this</a>]</i>,
and if I do, this persistent stupidity about keystrokes will probably be the #1
cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a

I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">pathetic losers</a>,

and probably
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">deserve to be in

There, wasn’t that fun?
Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

blogs as a matter of course.
Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an
insider’s feel for what this whole Solaris thing is <em>really</em> about can
bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent

<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

I may be out of step with the crowd but it seems

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>

<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.

a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our

original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug

The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for

poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/timf/20050109#solaris_on_the_desktop">this</a>]</i>,

cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html">Camels

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<title>Wintry</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP

<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">pathetic losers</a>, 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">ineffectual morons</a>,

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fidelityfunding.net">deserve to be in

There, wasn’t that fun?
Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an

bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent

<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using

McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

I may be out of step with the crowd but it seems

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<p>Via the Reg, I see NCD

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">another desktop</a>
<i>[Update: or maybe
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/timf/20050109#solaris_on_the_desktop">this</a>]</i>,
and if I do, this persistent stupidity about keystrokes will probably be the #1
cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<p>I’ve just been burned by a journalist for the first time in years, and I
really don’t like the feeling.  I’ve been doing this a long time, and I’ve
gotten to know a lot of the writers in this field, and often I’ll get emails
out of the blue saying “What do you think about XXX” and unless it’s
violently controversial or dangerous, I’ll tell them, and by and large
they’re smart and insightful and honest</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<title>Wintry</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

<p>For a while this morning, it seemed to have stopped. 
But as of 11:30 AM Pacific time, they’re back.
This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP

whoever it is that’s doing it and THREW THEIR ASS IN JAIL?</p>
<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">taken

I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are

Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

blogs as a matter of course.
Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an
insider’s feel for what this whole Solaris thing is <em>really</em> about can
bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent

<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running

unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using

McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

deployment of a bunch of XML technologies including UBL.  
Check out slides 4 &amp; 5: they estimate the annual savings achievable from

I may be out of step with the crowd but it seems

one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<p>Via the Reg, I see NCD

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to

<i>[Update: or maybe

cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.
<i>Item</i>: Joel Spolsky’s must-read
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html">Camels

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<title>Wintry</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

This is big and involves a lot of domain names and a well-known IP

<p>So I did a whois on one of the domain names that shows up, and there’s a
listing there, with people’s names and phone numbers, in New York.
I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

<a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">taken

I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.
For example, the recent referrer-spam perps, who are

Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t
count this link for ranking purposes, but do take its content seriously
as relevant to the indicated site.”</p>

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>
<p>A ton of people, way too many to list, suggested using
<code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code>, which is a subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>.  Whatever, it doesn’t seem like that big a
deal.</p>

<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out

So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an

bypass all the business-oriented official marketing stuff and go
straight to Bryan Cantrill’s excellent

good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using

McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and

<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

deployment of a bunch of XML technologies including UBL.  
Check out slides 4 &amp; 5: they estimate the annual savings achievable from
invoicing in UBL at somewhere between €100M and €160M.
I may be out of step with the crowd but it seems
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/14/UBL10">painfully obvious</a> to me that
UBL is going to be huge and I don’t understand why more technology vendors
(including my employer) aren’t refocusing their e-business strategy around
it.</p>

<title>Another Mac Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith another Macintosh usability hint, plus an amplification of some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">previous advice</a>.</p>
<img class="inline" src="NoMinimize.png" alt="Don’t use yellow button" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Hide, Don’t Minimize</h2>
<p>Back in 2003 I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/01/HowToUseOSX">offered some advice</a> on how to make the Dock useful;
one of them was never to click on that yellow “minimize” button.
Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of the OS X’s “Hide” function
(CMD-H in every app but PhotoShop, where it’s Shift-CMD-H). 
While, as noted, OS X, unlike Windows, deals well with tons of windows all
over the place, there’s no point keeping a window around for an app that I
use for 10 minutes once every other day, or for iTunes when it’s in
background-music shuffle mode.</p>
<p>Since no other popular GUI has a “hide” function as far as I know, the
utility may not be obvious to people like me who didn’t grow up in Mac-land,
but it’s actually real handy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Extra Screen Where?</h2>
<p>When you plug an extra screen into a Mac, you can use the “Arrangement”
tab of the Displays preference to say where you want it, logically, and which
screen you want the menu-bar on.
Being a typically neatness-conscious geek, I had had the screens neatly lined
up at the top; but now I realize that makes the menu a little harder to get
to.</p>
<img src="Arrangement.png" alt="How to arrange your outboard screen" />
<div class="caption"><p>The right way to do it.</p></div>
<p>This way, to get to the menu, you go to the main screen and throw the
mouse to the top left or right corner, and because the tops aren’t lined off,
it can’t slide off into the other screen.</p>

<title>Podcasting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I may not entirely get it, but I can’t ignore it, so herewith some
thoughts and predictions on the subject, plus obviously, a teeny little
podcast.</p>
<p>Let’s start with
Adam Curry’s Jan. 3rd <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/01/03">Daily Source
Code</a>, which I listened to last night.
Adam points out that podcast-listening is an activity best suited to when
you’re chilling out, kicking back, getting high, whatever.
I’d re-spin that slightly to say it works best when you’re awake but doing
something that’s occupying only part of your attention.
The canonical example would be commuting, I guess, something I’ve carefully
structured my life to avoid.
But last night I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide-scanning</a>, which
qualifies: (here’s a bit of the harvest: two cemetery shots, sometime in the
Eighties, from
the islands of Hawai’i and Kauai).</p>
<img src="0756.jpg" alt="Keopu Cemetery, island of Hawai’i" />
<img src="0809.jpg" alt="A cemetery on Kauai" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Would I Listen?</h2>
<p>Probably not to Adam; maybe once he gets past talking about podcasting
all the time, he’s probably more interesting on music and pop-culture.
He’s got a radio voice all right.
Maybe I’m just too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy cheerful
chatter about using Abba-tested techniques to protect your hair from your
headphones.  And frankly, if what Adam was passing along was the best of the
best from the podcast world, we’ve got a long way to go.
I find Dave Winer more content-ful, and he turns out to have a real
interesting voice.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I still think
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/11/Podcasting">the killer app is
music</a>.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that when the subject is technology, I’d rather
read about it than hear about it.
One reason is the interactivity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>’casting Isn’t Conversing</h2>
<p>Any activity with “casting” in the name suggests one-to-many, and indeed,
I think podcasting is way less interactive than conventional blogging.
The reason is that when I’m reading a blog, I’m 100% engaged and I’m sitting
at a keyboard. 
If something strikes a chord, it’s a matter of seconds to write in response;
either one-on-one to the author, or to the author and the world via <span
class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for listening to music, the interactivity deficit isn’t a problem.
But blogging is better than conventional publishing precisely because, at an
essential level, it’s two-way.</p>
<p>So I’m still waiting for musicians to start podcasting to route around
the wasteland of commercial music radio.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’ll Catch On</h2>
<p>Whatever the right niche is, I’m betting that podcasting is going to catch
on fast and big, for one reason: it’s so incredibly easy.
To prove it, 
<enclosure href="20050104-1344.mp3">here</enclosure> is a little chunk of
audio, which has been duly flagged in my RSS feed as an
<code>&lt;enclosure></code>.</p>
<p>I got the idea this morning, and in between the usual email and phone
calls and other work, I figured out how to get
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/broadcaster/">QuickTime
Broadcaster</a> to record off the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight’s</a> (fairly decent)
microphone, and then used Rogue Amoeba’s
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to
turn that into an MP3, and then did a half-hour’s tinkering with the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">publishing software</a> to get things
right.
The background music is from
<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/dac_crowell">DAC Crowell</a>, whom I
recommend highly.</p>
<p>Now, it could have been done a lot better and there’s a big slippery slope
of sound capture and mixing and enhancing tools waiting for the unwary,
but the easiest possible way turns out to be good enough.</p>
<p>When there’s something that produces an effect this dramatic, and with a
barrier to entry this low, chances are somebody’s going to figure out how to
make something happen with it.</p>

<title>Office Doc Format News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of low-key news items 
in the Office Document XML space, worth highlighting because
I think this area is significant, as do
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">some important people</a>.
First off, the people standardizing this stuff over at OASIS (and soon, ISO)
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2005-01-04-a.html">published a second
draft</a>, and, without any fanfare, they changed the name from
“OpenOffice.org XML Format” to “OpenDocument”, which is shorter, better, and
not tied to any particular implementation.
There’s action on the Microsoft front too; check the
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.office.xml">microsoft.public.office.xml</a>
and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml">microsoft.public.xml</a>
newsgroups, where there are flurries of questions digging through the knotty
corners of WordML and ExcelML; you never really understand a dialect until
you have to write a program to generate it.
I’m sure the details will come out despite 
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.xml/browse_thread/thread/ec47626088c12962/128957c5fb99646d">some
current irritation</a>, but this is a reason why Microsoft should cast a
friendly eye at the boring, bureaucratic, painful standardization process.</p>

<title>Bye, NCD</title>

<p>Via the Reg, I see NCD

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/ncd_closes_ops/">away</a>.
Kind of sad; I feel I have a personal relationship with the company.
I saw their first product at a 1989 Usenix and liked it enough to buy it and
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/c8606f5e1b932f46/1ba0511b452e344a">posted
a review</a> which generated storms of email and Usenet traffic and many
thank-yous from NCD and, I immodestly think, significantly helped get them
launched.
Obviously, our 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> is a direct descendant of the
original NCD idea, and the people here who use ’em generally love ’em.
I think it’s the nifty Java Card trick that makes them fly; go anywhere, plug
in the card, and there’s your desktop.
The notion, in an enterprise of any size, that you should have
independently managed standalone computers, one per person,
is obviously nuts.  There are some job functions and personality
types that call for a real computer of one’s own, but to the extent we can
avoid that, business is going to run smoother.</p>

</head>
<body>
<p>Jon Udell 
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/07/02OPstrategic_1.html">suggests</a>
a new documentation strategy for 
technology vendors; rather than going on publishing incomplete, out-of-date,
poorly written manuals, they could just set up a per-product Wiki and let
the customer base fill it up with problems, fixes, workarounds, tips &amp;
tricks.
As he points out, most of us have gotten used to searching the Web for user
reports, rather than cracking product docs, to help us solve problems.
He suggests doing it at the Wikipedia, but I don’t think it matters that much
where the thing lives.
Like many great ideas, it’s obvious once you think of it.  I’m quite sure
it’ll happen.</p>

<title>Fast (They Say) and Open</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a lot of people at Sun who are convinced that some sort of
binary XML representation is a good idea.
I’ve never been convinced, but they’re serious; they’ve
drafted a proposal and are working on getting it standardized; informally it’s
called the “Fast Infoset” and officially it’s
“ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1”.
I’ve been particularly dubious because it’s built on ASN.1, which
I’ve had bad experiences with.
But those mostly had to do with broken or unavailable software, and that
objection may be moot, because as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pelegri/archive/2005/01/start_using_bin.html">writes</a>,
they’re shipping an Open Source implementation.
Eduardo also tells me they’re getting lots of interest from outside of Sun.
Hey, as long as whenever someone tells me “I interchange XML” that means
they’re willing to interchange streams of Unicode characters with angle
brackets, I’m OK.</p>

<title>Jeremy and Keystrokes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that Jeremy Zawodny has
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">switched away
from Mac</a>, at least partially.
One of his reasons is also my #1 gripe with OS X, the primitive
keyboard access to application functions.  Windows and modern Linuxes both do
a much better job of this than OS X.
Apple refuses to worry about this because, they say,
<a href="http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">we’ve done the
research</a> and it shows that you pitiful peasants just <em>think</em>
keyboarding is faster, mousing is faster and we can prove it.
I personally don’t believe it.  When I, for example, want to flip a photo 90°
right (or left), it is quicker in PaintShop Pro to hit CTL-R, R (or L),
Enter (and if I’m flipping it the same way as last time, I can skip the R/L)
than it is in PhotoShop to grab the mouse and go through two levels of
cascading menus. 
Since I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey">persist in believing this</a>, am I a jungle-drumming anti-scientific
primitive?  
Well, once I tried to track down the experimental evidence, only it
doesn’t seem to be online, and the one time I found an abstract (this morning
I looked again and couldn’t find even that), it said something about measuring
the 
responses of “a variety of users across a variety of operations”.  Well, I
don’t give a flying flapdoodle about a variety of users and a variety of
operations; I care about the things that I do all the time, and by
definition, <strong>I am an expert</strong> at the things I do all the time,
and every time Apple makes me reach for the mouse, I swear.
I work for a company that would really like me to switch to

<i>[Update: or maybe

cause.

<title>Those IBM Patents</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Courtesy of ZDNet’s (very good)
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open source blog</a>,
a list of 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf">those
patents</a> IBM is releasing sans charge.
But what does it mean?</p>
<p>I frankly have no idea, but here’s some context.
As of this writing, IBM
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/portfolio.shtml">says</a>
that its “current active portfolio” contains about 23,000 patents, and that
in 2003 they received 3,415 new ones.</p>
<p>Patents aren’t free.
If you’re paying the retail rate to a decent law firm, one will cost you
in the range of US$10,000.  IBM should get economies of scale and not be
paying external law firms, but they’re spending at least $17M/year on this
stuff (just the lawyers, not the inventors).</p>
<p>So, this announcement means that IBM is unlocking 2.17% of their active
portfolio, representing a few million bucks in legal expenses.
At one level this is good; I mean, you have to be worried about
the legal overhang from
<i>US5694597: Method and system for optimizing access to a datastore</i>, or
<i>US5255387: Method and apparatus for concurrency control of shared data
updates and queries</i>, or <i>US6202098: Method and system for object
oriented notification</i> (to pick three completely at random from the page
I happened to have open).</p>
<p>But one is left with some questions: How were these selected?
Among the remaining 22,500 patents, are there some that IBM plans to begin
litigating?  Or probably won’t litigate, but might?  Or is this a general
statement that IBM will not bring its patent portfolio to bear against Open
Source software in general?
Inquiring minds want to know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a perusal of these patent titles would tend to reinforce the
cynical view that most software patents are complete unadulterated
bullshit.</p>

<title>Mini for Mom?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So is the Mini a game-changer? 
That question is too big.
But here’s an easier one: is it a good computer to buy
for my Mom?
<i>[Updated: Lots of feedback on what’s good for Mom, and on
appropriateness.]</i></p>
<img src="JeanBray.jpg" class="inline" alt="Jean Bray" />
<p>Jump <a href="#p-1">here</a> for the updates.</p>
<p>My mother is young and healthy enough that she’ll be needing a computer
for another decade or two for sure, and her 2000-vintage E-Machines Win98 box
is Just Not Gonna Cut It.
Especially now that she’s got broadband.</p>
<p>She’s got a perfectly good screen and printer and mouse, although her
keyboard’s kind of past it.  Plus she got a brand-new digicam at Christmas.
So on the surface, it would appear that the Mini might be a good
candidate.</p>
<p>Let’s go cost this out.
1.25 GHz and 512M ought to be fine, and we might as well spring the extra
pennies for the 80G drive, which will for her purposes be infinitely large.
So, if we add the Apple keyboard/mouse, it comes to $682.00, which is
not too bad at all.</p>
<img class="inline" src="MacMini.png" alt="Mac Mini" />
<p>Except for that’s not quite the whole story... Mom needs Office.
I don’t think the new iWork will help (no spreadsheet, to start
with) and much and all as I like
<a href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice/J</a>, I
don’t think it’s quite at ask-your-Mom-to-use-it level yet.
She has a horrible old copy of Office 97 that is of perhaps dubious
provenance (she says she doesn’t know where it came from, and I didn’t pay
for it), so I guess upgrades are out, and I see that Office for the Mac is
(gasp) $399.95!
Which frosts my socks, because this was supposed to be at least partly about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/WorldHQ">C-$2MS</a>.
Mom is an active student and takes all sorts of courses through the
senior-citizens’ centre, but I bet that doesn’t qualify her for the $149.95
“Student and Teacher” edition.</p>
<p>I feel a slogan coming on: <strong>Microsoft is mean to little old
ladies!</strong> Not bad, eh?
Seriously, they should consider a senior-citizens discount, every museum and
concert hall and public-transit system in the world has one.</p>
<p>As for the hardware, people have pointed out that if you stay in the Wintel
world, you can get a little more for a little less.
But then we’d have more or less the same
Office problem over there.</p>
<p>The other option, then would be JDS or Knoppix or whatever; I suspect Mom
would do just fine with OpenOffice, but there might be a psychological
barrier as she had a bad experience with a much earlier version.</p>
<p>Speaking of psychological barriers; Mom’s a super-smart person and youthful
for her age, but is it fair to ask her to learn a whole new user interface?
She’s still prone to grumbling about how some of the things that she was used
to in Windows 3.1 don’t work any more.
My intuition is that the total irritation from having to use Windows into the
grave will be noticeably greater than the one-time irritation of learning OS
X.
So on balance, I suspect that there’s a Mini in Mom’s future. 
But if we end up paying the full ticket for Office, you can count on 
reading some irritated prose here.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>First of all, it turns out that the Student and Teacher edition is
probably an available choice; my appallingly-cynical readership scoffed at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/students/doyouqualify.mspx">letter
of the law</a>.  I quote (name
withheld to protect the guilty): “Microsoft expects that everybody’s gonna
buy one of those for their three computers at home, they know business can’t
get away with it so this gets them in the door, residentially.”
Hmph.</p>
<p>Second, Simon Phipps
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/2005/01/playground-kids.htm">reports</a> that
his Mum does just fine with NeoOffice/J, maybe I’m being too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The interesting debate was with my brother Rob Bray, her other sysadmin,
and the source of her (perfectly legal, as it turns out) copy of Office 97.
He contended strongly that Mom should stay in Windows-land because that’s
the mainstream option and she’d have the maximum interop and minimum friction
with her peers.</p>
<p>Aren’t children awful?  Here we were arguing away without even asking Mom.
Eventually we were polite enough to invite her into the conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim: “Rob's all mad at me.  In a friendly way.  He thinks it's madness to
consider anything but Windows, because that's what all your friends will be
using.”</p>
<p>Mom: “Not all of them, some of the people at the Centre have Apples and
have had for years. And most people are fairly irritated with Microsoft, and
if someone else started praising a new system, you never know what might
happen. Contrary to traditional belief, seniors are experimenters and like to
try new things. We even vote NDP, not all conservative or liberal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you go.</p>

<title>PhotoShop Elements 3 Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Skipping to the conclusion: It’s good, if you’re using Elements already go
upgrade. 
But along the way, there 
are thoughts on software’s lifespan and  pricing.
Plus, a thin black woman kissing a flower taller than herself.</p>
<img src="1144.jpg" alt="A tetrahedron-shaped lamp and flower arrangements on a dark wood surface" />
<div class="caption"><p>On the dark wood chest are a tetrahedron-shaped lamp
and some flower arrangements.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Main Thing</h2>
<p>Elements 3—the Mac version at least—is faster; much faster.
The illustrations in this piece are
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">slide scans</a>, and quite
large; the one 
above is 4739x3285, 8.45M on disk.
On E2, they were painfully slow to load and save, and now they’re pretty
snappy; at least twice as fast.
The various filtering and cropping operations don’t feel any faster, which is
fine because they were pretty well OK before.  
But that loading and saving has really juiced up my workflow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Little Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The level of fit &amp; finish is just generally better, everything’s a
little slicker and a little smoother.
They’ve reorganized the screen layout and well, whatever, there are a few
more pixels of photospace available in among the tools, which is good.</p>
<img src="1167.jpg" alt="Two african figurines and flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>Two African figurines keep the flowers company.</p></div>
<p>There are a bunch of little changes in keystrokes and layouts and
selection behavior, some of which help and others don’t.  Whatever.
The new “Healing Brush” tool is pretty neat.</p>
<p>There are some stability issues, I’ve already had a couple of crashes when
loading and saving these big-ass slide scans.</p>
<p>It’s still stupidly lacking in keyboard shortcuts, but hey, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/09/JeremyOut">Apple has proved that doesn’t matter</a>.</p>
<p>On balance, anyone who’s using Elements already should totally upgrade,
and anyone who’s shopping for photogeek software a step up from iPhoto, this
is a pretty good option.</p>
<img src="1163.jpg" alt="African figurine, flower arrangement" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Kiss.</p></div>
<p>Plus, the price is right.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Pricing</h2>
<p>Via Amazon.ca, Elements 3 cost me C$107.99, which is to say C$128.75
all-in with shipping and taxes.
Which is an interesting price-point, and leads me to another new-year
prediction: 2005 is going to be a pivotal year for software pricing.
<i>Item</i>: Joel Spolsky’s must-read

<div class="caption"><p>There’s another African artifact there, a sort of swagger stick.
Consider the texture of the walls.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Old New Thing</h2>
<p>While we may be entering a new era in software pricing, we’re not entering
an era of new software.
Remember Photoshop Elements, how we got started on this ramble? 
It’s basically good ol’ PhotoShop stripped down a bit, and that’s in release,
what, three hundred and twelve?
And let’s look at some other recent high-impact software releases: Solaris
10, Linux 2.6 (which means, more or less, 5), Oracle 10<i>g</i>, Windows XP
(which identifies itself to a Web server as “Windows NT 5.1”), Office 2003
(internally called “Office 11”), Mac OS X 10.3 (which is in large part
Darwin, which is in large part *bsd release, uh, some big number).
Not one of these pieces of software is under ten years old.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: want to have high impact in the software world?
Go to work on something big, old, and well-established; make it
better.</p>

<body>
<p>Last week, we had one of our rare Vancouver snowstorms. 
But the stuff’s still on the ground.</p>
<p>The day of a snowfall here, people are cheery and fatalistic about it; the
city’s not set up for it, but it doesn’t happen very
often and it’s a novelty.
The snow stacks up bright on the apples that neglected to leave the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP1367.jpg" alt="Fresh snow falling on apples in the tree" />
<p>The children run wild in a universe entirely occupied by snowballs, sleds,
snow forts, and of course snow people.
I thought our jaunty specimen was shaped more like a snow lady, but
5&#xbd;-year-olds are traditionalists and he wouldn’t have it.</p>
<img src="Snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman" />
<p>The Christmas lights, which should be down by now but I’m not climbing
ladders until it gets 10° warmer, are warm in the dusky white.</p>
<img src="IMGP1379.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in snow" />
<p>But like I said, that was last week.
The snow is hard and icy and dirty now, like in some big city back East, and
we remember how one winter back there, five months in, we decided to move
three time-zones West to get away from this shit.</p>
<p>It’s getting us all down, even the snowman.</p>

<title>Real World Web Services</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/realwws/">O’Reilly book</a> by Will
Iverson, whom I don’t know.
Given my
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">frequent public
grumbling</a> on the subject, I thought I should give it a serious look.</p>
<p>The title could have been <cite>Practical Web Services</cite> and been
just as accurate; this book is blessedly free of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
astronautics</a>.
It devotes almost no space to theory or models or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">specifications
maps</a>, but it has actual code-complete Web-Services apps
which talk to Amazon, EBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB, Blogger, and
LiveJournal, often several at once.
The nearest it gets to theory is crash introductions to Apache’s Tomcat,
XML-RPC, and Axis, plus the Quartz scheduler, plus RSS.
All the implementations are Java, in particular there’s quite a bit of JSP.</p>
<p>It has a frankly dismissive closing <cite>Future Web Services
Directions</cite> chapter, which seems about right to me.
Money quote, which does not 100% reflect my world-view but is worth
reproducing: <i>Unfortunately, if the examples as shown in this book are any
indication, REST-based projects are liable to lead to considerably more
client code for the maintenance of the XML processing as compared to
SOAP-based solutions.</i></p>
<p>People who care about Web Services in the wild should check this one out.
And so, especially, should WS-Architecture-Astronauts.</p>

I ask for them, I get the books free.]</i></p>

<title>Strange &amp; Norrell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, an immensely large novel whose stylish
white-on-black and black-on-white covers are occupying miles of shelf-space
everywhere.
Summary: it’s a good book.
Herewith notes plus ramblings on travel and reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaming Heathrow</h2>
<p>What happened was, I came home from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/16/Javapolis">Antwerp</a> via Brussels and
London.
Northern Europe’s weather was bad and the air schedules were hurting; the
flight to Heathrow was delayed.
Bearing my tight connection to Vancouver in mind, I decided to check my rollie
as luggage, although it’s perfectly legal in the cabin.
(This caused a little difficulty after I Christmas-shopped in Brussels
airport and staggered onto the plane festooned with shopping bags 
like a mall victim).</p>
<p>Anyhow, Heathrow, as usual, was congested and slow and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/01/HeathrowSucks">generally sucked</a>,
and by the time I finally got to the Air Canada desk, the fellow shook his
head doubtfully: “I’m afraid you are rather late, sir.”  
I smiled sweetly and said “I do have checked luggage,” knowing full well that
it would have transited Heathrow much faster than I and be secure in the
plane’s hold.
He looked pained and reached for his phone to call the gate.
In this era of terrorism, no plane can fly without a passenger in the cabin
belonging to each and every bag in the belly.
And they really don’t want to unpack the hold to find that one unaccompanied
Samsonite.</p> 
<p>As I finally got into the terminal, the big voice in the rafters was
intoning “Will Mr. Bray please proceed now to Gate 389.”
But I had a problem; I’d realized that I’d read everything in my carry-on
and was about to get on a 10-hour flight <i>sans</i> pages to turn.
Unthinkable.
But hey, I had a bag in the plane, so I stopped by the bookshop (Heathrow’s
one redeeming feature) and that’s how I got this book (and read the first
two-thirds of it).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange &amp; Norrell</h2>
<p>The best thing about this book is the plot and pace; it lopes right along,
really never failing to be entertaining.
Some have complained about the idiosyncratic deployment of Jane Austen
spelling; I don’t think it helps much but it doesn’t get in the way either.
The people in it are largely interesting and most are nicely fleshed out,
with only a few spear-carriers.
The cameos from famous historical personages—Wellington, Byron (especially),
the mad King George—are good fun, and the locations—here and there in
Britain, Spain in the peninsular war, Venice—have lots of colour and feel
historically authentic.
The reviews say it’s full of literary references, but I only spotted a
couple so I guess I’m not literate enough.</p>
<p>The two protagonists, named in the title, English magicians both, are
twitchily obsessive about their work in a way computer geeks will find
familiar and comforting.
And the magic itself is really very good; a plausible presentation of what
real magic in the real world might be like, should such a thing exist.</p>
<p>One gripe; our authoress’ cast of characters is very male-heavy; the women
who appear do so mostly as hapless victims of magic, pawns at best on the
board. 
I would beg Ms Clarke, in her heavily-prefigured sequel, to include one or
two interesting members of her own gender.</p>
<p>But on balance I think this is a good story well told, and most people
would like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reading in General</h2>
<p>I’m going through a lot fewer books these days; the problem is that the
combination of RSS, wireless, and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">decent on-screen typography</a> has
made it terribly convenient to read the world in real time, instead of reading
books, and the world is telling an interesting story, almost always.
It’s hard for authors to compete.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve swung too far away from books toward the world, and am
going to make a conscious effort to swing back a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll say one thing though; text presented in ink on paper is a
highly-advanced technology, better than what you can get from a computer
screen.
Within certain limitations; although <cite>Strange &amp; Norrell</cite> is
elegantly typeset in Baskerville with generous leading, its 782 pages make it
awkwardly large, thick, and heavy.
Something lightweight and electronic would be a lot easier on the wrists.</p>

<title>Group Blogs?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re out there talking to people about Enterprise Blogging, and one of
the things we keep hearing is “We want to do group blogs.”
Well, the customer is always right, so groupblogging is looming larger and
larger in the
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project">Roller</a> to-do list.
I’m surprised and unconvinced; out there in the world, group blogs are the
exception rather than the rule.
I suspect that there may be some excess caution at work; people a bit
reluctant to start talking to the world feeling that doing it in a group
context will be somehow less exposed.
On this one, I’d advise going with the flow, and the flow today is mostly
about individual voices.
But I learned long ago not to tell people what they should and
shouldn’t want to do with technology.</p>

<title>Referrer Spamstorm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Near as I can tell, pretty well every somewhat-visible website in the
world is seeing its logfiles fill up with with bogus page fetches there only
as a vehicle for a spammish “referrer” field; whether or not the site posts
referrer data.
This high-volume flood is a fairly recent phenomenon, and what makes it weird
is that the vast majority of the bogus referrer sites are off the air due to
some terms-of-service violation.
It would appear that a sleazebag somewhere launched a really ambitious
assault on the whole 
world—using, I can only assume, a few zillion zombified drone machines—only
to be found out and have their hosting yanked while their mindless slaves
continue to spew vacuous venom into logfiles everywhere.
Damn, the Internet is a weird place.

I called the 212- phone number and a woman’s voice said “Hello?”
It dawned on me that the phone number could be another forgery, so I just said
“wrong number” and hung up.

<title>Two Licenses</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s an interesting debate around syndication licensing going on,
<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/2005/01/14.html">launched</a> by
Martin Schwimmer, with the important links aggregated by
Scoble (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9211">here</a>,
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/16.html#a9213">here</a>).
I think the conclusion is obvious; some people, including me, need to have
different licenses for site and feed.</p>
<p>Schwimmer may not have a firm grasp of the issues, but he does have a
point; it’s reasonable to be concerned about Person A building a business
around Person B’s feed.</p>
<p>Reasonable to be concerned, I say; but not reasonable to try to stop 
happening.  At the end of the day it’s just nuts to 
try to fine-tune what other people do with your syndication feed.
Which is to say, if you’re putting your full content in your feed, I think
you’re pretty much giving it to the world.  Whether you want to or not, it’s
in the nature of the syndication beast. 
Not just RSS; Atom ain’t gonna change this.</p>
<p>Here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, quite a few fragments are not all
there in the feed; and none of the photos are.
For a variety of reasons, outside the scope of this debate, that’s not going
to change.
And whether or not I like what people do with my feed (I mean
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/timbray/">this</a> seems kind of
lame, but harmless), I don’t see much point in trying to control it.</p>
<p>I don’t want others trying to cash in on my long essays and pictures
though, and I’ve already gone after people who are replicating the whole
thing, and I’ll do it again any time I see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, that what I’ve just said here is inconsistent with
what I say on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Copyright">my copyright page</a>.
I think my
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons
license</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0) arguably says you can’t reproduce
my feed for your own business purposes, i.e. do what Bloglines does.</p>
<p>It seems to me the right solution is obvious; rewrite things to apply a
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license to the syndication feeds,
while retaining Attribution-NonCommercial coverage for the full text and
photos; hmm, an initial read suggests I need separate licenses for text and
photos.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something obvious?
By the way,
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> pointed this out to me
months ago, but neither of us thought it was that big a deal.</p>

I can see another application: it allows me to express negative feelings
hypertextually without collateral Google-juice damage.

Which suggests an enhancement: <code>rel="justlabel"</code>, which says “don’t

<title>Testing Backward</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just wasted some time by making a real dumb mistake in my unit testing
setup, and I think that when tech bloggers do this they should publish 
the details,
because wisdom is in large part the knowledge of how to avoid doing dumb
things, and thus grows globally as a function of the published inventory of
stupid mistakes.
Thus, herewith, a description of how you can waste time by 
doing your unit testing just slightly wrong.
<i>[Updated: A suggested best practice to avoid this.]
[And again.]</i></p>
<p>Scenario: you’re writing a class that has a real complex constructor, and
one that you’re pretty sure is going to be a performance bottleneck;
despite your best efforts to avoid premature optimization, you end up with an
80-line constructor including a couple of nested loops and a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search</a>.
The rest of the methods have names like <code>size()</code> and
<code>first()</code> and don’t do much.</p>
<p>Using your best XP/TDD style, you bang out <code>return null;</code> and
<code>return -1;</code> bodies for all the little methods, and dive into
getting that constructor right, and then you really bear down on some good
unit tests for it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the first few runs blow up in <code>testConstructor()</code>
with null pointers and infinite loops and so on, you fix them feeling
virtuous, this how TDD is supposed to go, right?</p>
<p>After a while, it’s not instantly blowing up, but you can’t seem to get
your basic sanity-check tests to work, it seems that your constructor is
laboring mightily and producing nothing.
You end up single-stepping in the debugger, and sure enough, it sure looks
like the object is getting constructed.
But all the tests show it as empty.</p>
<p>At this point, you go elsewhere for coffee, except for walking down the
hall you say “Oh shit” out loud, because you suddenly remembered all those
<code>return null;</code> and <code>return -1;</code> stub methods that you
were going to get to later, and you’d used them in the Constructor test to
look at your object, hadn’t you?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How To Avoid This</h2>
<p>In another hemisphere, <a href="http://randomised.blogspot.com/">Tony
Fisk</a> shared a giggle at me around
<a href="http://www.invetech.com.au/">his workplace</a>, where a person named
Greg Presneill suggested: “Or, just throw a
<code>System.NotImplementedException</code> instead 
of arbitrary <code>return -1;</code> or <code>return null;</code> etc.”
That’s .NET-talk, the Java equivalent would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException("Method not implemented");</code></pre>
<p>Obvious once you hear it, and immensely safer and better for stubs; I
assume lots of people are already doing it.</p>

<title>Inauguration Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On this occasion, I’d like to wish our American neighbours the best of
luck over the next four years; and I think you’re going to need it.
I was one of the tiny percentage of non-Americans who thought invading Iraq
might be sane, but then I thought then and I think now that it’s not OK 
to start a war based on on a bunch of bald-faced lies and yes, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/09/IntelReport">they knew they were
lying</a>.
Now, everyone knows
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4169107.stm">the WMDs were never
there</a> (check out the
<a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020470.php">desperate sniveling</a>
from the pro-administration camp).
I, like I suspect a large majority of the civilized world, really hope
that the Iraquis manage against the odds to pull off a decent election and end
up with some sort of a decent society, and that the US kids sweating it out
and dying in the desert manage to make it home alive.
Whatever you think about that, a majority of Americans disagreed with my
opinion that if the US were a business, it was time to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004 ">fire the boss</a>.
So, today, tens of millions get poured into the inauguration
ceremonies.
Meanwhile, bafflingly, it seems like
<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005443.php">they’re
doing it again</a> and once again, it seems to be
working. 
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Big Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Late in 2004, I began to be troubled by Big Ideas. 
When I started, like so many others, on some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/31/PicturesOfNothing">New-Year’s
predictions</a>, I found myself looking at several paragraphs of grandiose
prose about the Shape Of The New Economy, 
but chickened out and decided to scale them back.
But it doesn’t cost anything to publish here, and nobody has to read anything
I write, and this kind of public discourse is first-rate
as a way of getting things off your mind.
So: <em>Manufacturing is the new farming.
Health is the #1 growth sector.
China is what its name says it is.
Cottage industry is more interesting than heavy industry.
</em>
That’s what I think, anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Manufacturing Is the New Farming</h2>
<p>At one time, nearly everyone was a farmer, including my father and Lauren’s
mother (she still is).
Now, in the rich world, nearly nobody is; the percentage is down into the low
single digits.
For two reasons: First, most people, given a choice, choose something else,
and second, most farming tasks are straightforwadly automated, reducing the
required headcount.</p>
<p>Why is manufacturing any different?  Most people, given the choice of
working in a factory or nearly anywhere else, wouldn’t choose the factory
(I’ve worked in three factories).
In the end-game, manufacturing will be just as automated and 
depopulated as agriculture.</p>
<p>If you look at a graph of the proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing, it’s on an inexorable downward curve.
The proportion may not get as low as that engaged in farming, but who knows,
it may get lower?</p>
<p><i>[Find some graphs of the proportion of the population in farming and
manufacturing over some time periods, it would be nice if the shapes were
similar.]</i></p>
<p>There are countervailing forces: mostly what we call “offshoring”, the
practice of exporting manufacturing to where people are cheaper.
But this process clearly has an end in sight.
To start with, a robot earns the same in Cleveland and Shanghai.
But more important, places that do well via cheap labour inevitably progress
and grow and after a while the labour isn’t cheap any more.
Japan, for example, used to be a cheap-labour economy.</p>
<p>Also, people in China would like to move out of factories and into offices
just like we in the West have; my employer, Sun Micrososystems, already
employs a big group of engineers in China and it’s not because they’re
cheap.</p> 
<p>And when the Chinese labour pool isn’t cheap any more, well, that was the
last remaining big pool in the world; it’s a whale and everywhere else
is a minnow.</p>
<p>Which means, as time goes by, that more and more and more of us are going
to be in some sort of a services business.
Which service business, in particular?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Medicine Is the Ultimate Growth Sector</h2>
<p>In mid-2004 <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> ran a
special survey of the Economics of Medicine; it was a tremendously
impressive piece of work.</p>
<p><i>[Look up and quote from survey]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: in the Western world, we haven’t stamped out
poverty, but most people have plenty of money.
Take a random walk through any North American or European town; check out the
shiny cars, the satellite dishes, the coffee-shops full of
well-dressed people at every hour of day and night, the malls, the teeming
airports.</p>
<p>All this gleaming stuff and leisure fun; how much is it worth, compared to
good health?
Once you’re not too worried about food and shelter, <em>everything</em>
is dust and ashes compared to your health.
So, despite the political whingeing about costs, in the big picture the
system has very little price resistance.</p>
<p>And medicine is less suceptible to automatation than just about anything,
and requires the services of skilled, expensive people.</p>
<p>How big could the health industries get, as a dollar proportion of the
economy or a human proportion of the population?  Fifty percent?  Easily.
Higher?  Not impossible at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Is What Its Name Says It Is</h2>
<p>The Chinese word for China translates literally, I am told, more or less
as “Midland”, the land in the middle.
I’m pretty sure that for some number of decades starting now, China is indeed
at the centre of the world.</p>
<p>It has the most people, it has fantastic economic growth combined with
poverty-stricken peasantry, it has oppressed minorities ready for the spark
of revolt, and its political system looks untenably old-fashioned in a
Twentyfirst-Century context.  How could it not be a news factory?</p>
<p>A few things that could happen:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open rebellion, secessionist terrorism
being met with brutal repression in the bad old pattern, breaks out in two or
more of China’s Southwestern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of hundred million peasants, having noticed the
bright lights in the big cities where the streets are paved with gold,
decide to move to town, walking if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Threatened by some combination of popular unrest and economic turmoil,
the governent decides to leverage the powerful forces of Chinese nationalism
to cement their position, by launching aggressive war against Taiwan; not
really caring that much whether they win, or even for the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cottage Industry Is More Interesting than Heavy Industry</h2>
<p>A bunch of people I know suddenly decided, in the past year, to leave the
orbit of conventional business and strike out on their own, making things to
sell and selling them, usually via the Net.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Great Hippie Retreat Back To The
Land <i>circa</i> 1972, the lawyers who decided to become toymakers and
bedtime-story writers and organic beekeepers.</p>
<p><i>[Graphic: proportion of the population who are self-employed.]</i></p>
<p>But that was then, this is now.  The Net is a qualitative game changer,
the Long Tail isn’t going away, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be to
take your wares to the world.  Not easy, just easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s going to work, but the desire to get out of the
cubicle and do something creative is widespread and palpable, you
can smell it in the streets.
Something will happen in this space, we just don’t know what yet.</p>

<title>Friday Slide Scan: Driftwood</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Others may practice Friday Catblogging, and a regularly-scheduled event is
a fine thing, so I’ve decided to institute one.
I regularly dedicate a late-evening hour or two to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">scanning old slides</a> (it
multiplexes nicely with other activities) and I now have an inventory of
2,000 or so, and it’s growing.
So, rather than let them languish unloved in the safe but cold embrace of
DVD-ROMs, I shall drop one here at the end of most weeks.
This week: driftwood on some Pacific-Rim beach, circa 1990.</p>
<img src="0994.jpg" alt="White Pacific driftwood on dark stones" />
<p>Images from the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1955
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>The Decline of Script</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think the fine art of handwriting is about done for.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: My handwriting is so bad I have trouble reading it any more.
It’s not rocket science, I’ve been sitting in front of a computer for two and
a half decades, what do you expect?
It’s gotten to the point that I no longer apologize for popping open the
laptop to take notes in meetings, even with people in suits.
And I frequently find that I’m not carrying a pen when I have to fill out the
customs forms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> While my little 5&#xbd;-year-old is learning reading 
quite smoothly, he really has a long way to go on writing the letters
clearly, in a line, and not mirror-imaged.
But he exchanges emails with his Grandma and, while the hunting-and-pecking
is slow, he gets the job done and isn’t frightened of the keyboard.
If I were him, I’d already be asking why I had to master this awkward analog
“pencil” technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sad</h2>
<p>This is kind of sad, because a person’s handwriting says quite a lot about
them; there was a time when I cared about mine and was proud that it was
legible, attractive, and idiosyncratic.  Now it’s just chicken scratches.
But if you’re creating text in any volume, a keyboard is just a better way to
go about doing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pencils Aren’t Going Away</h2>
<p>Notice that I talked about “handwriting” and “script”.  Every human being
is obviously going to have to be able to form letters, if only to scribble
“Out of Order” on broken equipment or “I’m off picking up Joey”
on a note on the fridge.
And calligraphy will stand alone as a craft forever.
But the practice of cursive script—remember the word “Penmanship”?—is I
suspect in its dying days.</p>

<title>Memory Criminal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith advice on
<a href="http://www.satech.com">where to buy memory</a> if you’re in Silly
Valley, and how to stay out of trouble with the Canadian government.</p>
<p>What happened was, my PowerBook gets kind of sluggish when I’m running
NetBeans and PhotoShop Elements and twenty or thirty Safari tabs, and since
Apple obstinately refuses to release a faster laptop, and since I’m not
<em>quite</em> ready to switch to some musclebound 64-bit Solaris laptop,
well, memory was a logical next step.</p>
<p>So I followed the advice of worthies on the internal Sun Mac mailing-list
and made a date and dropped by
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, which is about five
blocks from the Sun Santa Clara campus, and they bumped me from 768M to 1.5G
in about five minutes for what seemed like a fair price.</p>
<p>Plus, they offer an unconditional guarantee, and reports are that they
honor it, no muss no fuss.
Plus, they’re friendly.</p>
<p>If you go there, write down the <em>whole</em> address, they don’t exactly
have a 30-foot neon sign over the storefront. 
Memory is all they do, but they seem to do it well; talk about microniche
marketing.</p>
<p>Juicing up the PowerBook has indeed helped quite a bit, but I bet I get
driven to x86 land, because I look at the range of G4 and G5 options available
to Apple, and just don’t see their highend-laptop options being that great for
the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smuggler!</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I got back home on the late flight and I realized, literally
as I was stepped up in front of the Canada Customs woman, that I’d
forgotten to declare the new memory as something I was importing to Canada,
buried in the computer’s guts it didn’t feel like something in a shopping bag.
I made a snap decision not to revise my story while standing in front of the
official; I’m not sure whether I was more worried about looking suspicious or
just dopey.
So, since I got waved through as a law-abiding citizen, I am now
guilty of having avoided the payment of about C$30 in tax, which I could have
dodged legally just by being away for 72 hours or more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the Canadians in the crowd, here’s some advice. 
While there is a longstanding Canadian tradition of lying to Customs
officials at The World’s Longest Undefended Border, it’s not worthwhile any
more.</p>
<p>First of all, they’re really generous with the exemptions;
unless you’re seriously over, they’ll just say “forget it” and wave
you through.  And if you do wind up having to pay something, usually it’s
just GST, thus cheap, and they’re friendly and super-efficient about
collecting, they take 
your credit card and charge you and turn you loose in no time (although one
time I went through really late at night and the cashier, when I pulled out
the card, beseeched me for cash &amp; change if I could possibly spare any,
she was running low and there was a 747 from Hong Kong about to arrive).</p>
<p>Bottom lines: tell the truth to the Canadian officials; and buy your
memory on De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara.</p>

<title>Stronger Foundations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Net today is standing on slightly firmer foundations than it was a few
weeks back.  On December 15th, the W3C issued
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web,
Volume One</a> as a “Recommendation”, i.e. as close as they get to calling
anything a standard.
If you read it, there’s a lot of focus on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
as in what we usually confuse with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">Universal Republic of Love</a>).
Today saw the final publication of the URI specification as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>, also known (even
more impressively) as IETF Internet Standard #66; some of the IETF’s most
widely-deployed protocols never make it to “Full Standard” status.
I’m hopelessly biased because I helped write both of these documents, but I
think that each is individually important and that the combination is really
important.
Most people can’t possibly imagine how much work it is to grind these things
out, and how many revisions it takes to get one right.
I originally wrote all of what is now Section 6 of RFC3986, and I think
there are very few sentences in there that haven’t been updated a few
times, almost all for the better, and almost all the work was done by Roy
Fielding, who deserves a deep bow from us all.
The Internet and the Web aren’t things and they’re not places, they’re a
<a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> that allow us to talk
to each other and to be less 
stupid.  These two documents are important links in that mesh.</p>

Speaking of which, the hardcore geeks in the crowd who want to get an

<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=960&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">writes
good stuff</a> on
something I’ve been talking about for a long time, private syndication feeds.
My favorite examples have been feeds from my bank account or credit card or
stock portfolio, but David has another for people like EBay, who
can no 
longer email their customers because everyone receiving such an email assumes
it’s a phishing attempt (it usually is).
David wonders if existing RSS-based systems can scale up for mass one-to-one
usage; the answer is “yes, obviously”;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/09/PublishAndPoll">post-and-poll</a> (as
in syndication) is
mechanically simpler than store-and-forward (as in email), it’ll scale just
fine.
One detail: I think that for this kind of content-critical, all-business feed,
Atom is a more attractive choice than any of the RSS flavors.</p>

<title>More Patent Funnies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Perhaps just now it’s unfashionable to grumble about patents, given that
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/26/0534206">Sun</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/11/IBM-Patents">IBM</a> are showering the
world with bucketfuls of ’em (and a fine thing, too), but if you want a loud,
ugly, wake-up call, start at
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/">VarChars</a>, which is offered by someone
who apparently wishes to be known only as “rayg”.
Samples:
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/156">
IBM Receives Patent for Using Regular Expressions to Extract Information from
Documents</a>,
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/153">Google Receives Patent for
Highlighting of Search Results</a>, and
<a href="http://varchars.com/blog/node/view/146">Microsoft Attempts to Patent
Object Persistence</a>. 
Read on for some predictably-negative commentary and—gasp!—a look inside some
incredibly-advanced Google technology.</p>
<p>First the conclusion: I’ve already written that the idea of a patent on
software is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">not inherently
broken</a>, but rayg’s site is still more evidence that the system in use in
the U.S. for granting them is, perhaps beyond repair.</p>
<p>Enough generalities, let’s look at specifics; specifically,
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,839,702.WKU.">U.S. Patent 6,839,702</a>,
granted to Google on January 4, 2005, for highlighting matches to search terms
in retrieved documents.
The idea is nicely summarized by this figure from the application:</p>
<img src="Fig-6.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 6" />
<p>Gosh, I seem to recall having this same conversation in 1987, back
working on the search engine at the New <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>
project.
“So you see where we highlight the match in the result summary?” “Yeah.”
“Well, it would be nice if we could do that in the actual doc too when they
fetch it.” “I suppose.”  “Not hard to do, I wouldn’t think?”  “Nah, a bit
tedious, but we have all the info.”</p>
<p>I’m going to try to put this as moderately as I can... 
<strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVENTION!  THIS IS A MINOR PRODUCT FEATURE THAT ANY
HALF-ASS COMPETENT SOFTWARE ENGINEER COULD IMPLEMENT WITHOUT MENTAL STRESS!
THIS PATENT IS COMPLETE UNADULTERATED HORSE-SHIT!</strong>
Yep, that was as moderate as I could be.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the whimsical fluffery that constitutes the U.S. Patent
process, I’ve enclosed a couple of more figures from that Google patent.
The “Systems and methods for highlighting search results” are designed to
work on something called a “computer”, illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<img src="Fig-5.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 5" />
<p>Well, to be fair, they do go a little deeper than that, they explain
pictorially how things are organized inside that computer.</p>
<img src="Fig-3.png" alt="US Patent 6,839,702, Figure 3" />
<p>Gotta love that “miscellaneous data”.  Some of mine is very
miscellaneous.</p>
<p>I’ll close with yet another tip o’ the hat to our colleagues from Poland
who are
<a

<p>What, the story isn’t obvious?
Well, it’s like this:
There’s an instance of Zeppelin running somewhere in the background, and then
I’m running 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, and I’ve got
unit-test code in 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> wired up to the servlet API using 
<a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/JythonWebAppTutorial.html">Sean
McGrath’s excellent trick</a>.</p>
<p>And they’re all talking to each other and the unit test is emitting the
right answer, which is 3.
The number of layers of software sloshing around is frightening if you think
about it, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is get NetBeans (which already has Tomcat built-in)
a little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/19/NB4-plus">smarter about Jython</a> and
