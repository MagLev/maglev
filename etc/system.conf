# Name - system.conf
#
# Purpose - Default System-wide MagLev Configuration File
#
#	Note:  Configuration option strings are case-INSENSITIVE.
#
# This file has been shortened. The full version is in $GEMSTONE/data/

#=========================================================================
# DBF_SCRATCH_DIR:  A scratch directory that the stone process can use to
#  create "scratch" DBFs, used during pageaudit and page repair.  The file
#  name is appended to the directory name WITHOUT an intervening delimiter,
#  so a trailing delimiter is necessary here.
# Default: $GEMSTONE/data/
DBF_SCRATCH_DIR = $GEMSTONE_DATADIR/extent/scratch.;

#=========================================================================
# DUMP_OPTIONS:  Dump summary of all configuration options applicable to
#  the executable reading the config file.
#
#  Used by all executables.
# Default: TRUE
# DUMP_OPTIONS = TRUE;

#=========================================================================
# GEM_MAX_SMALLTALK_STACK_DEPTH
#   Size of GemStone Smalltalk execution stack space allocated at GciLogin time,
#   in units of approximate number of method activations.
#   Causes heap memory allocation of approximately 64 bytes per activation.
# Default: 1000 min: 100 max: 1000000
# GEM_MAX_SMALLTALK_STACK_DEPTH = 1000;

#=========================================================================
# GEM_NATIVE_CODE_ENABLED
#
# If true, enables the generation and use of native code.
#
# Runtime equivalent: #GemNativeCodeEnabled can be used
#   to disable native code, cannot be used to reenable
#   native code once it has been disabled during a session .
#
GEM_NATIVE_CODE_ENABLED = TRUE;

#=========================================================================
# STN_HALT_ON_FATAL_ERR: If TRUE, stone will halt and dump core if it
#   receives a notification from a gem that the gem died with a fatal error.
#   The value FALSE will cause stone to attempt to keep running if
#   a gem encounters a fatal error.
#  Runtime equivalent: #StnHaltOnFatalErr
#  Default: TRUE
# STN_HALT_ON_FATAL_ERR = TRUE;
# do not checkin, Ruby demo default
STN_HALT_ON_FATAL_ERR = FALSE;

#=========================================================================
# STN_TRAN_FULL_LOGGING
#    If TRUE, all transactions are logged, and log files are not deleted
#  by the system.  A given log file must be archived to tape before that
#  position in the circular list of log directories (STN_TRAN_LOG_DIRECTORIES)
#  is needed again.
#    If FALSE, only transactions smaller than STN_TRAN_LOG_LIMIT are logged;
#  larger transactions become checkpoints, and log files are deleted by
#  the system when the circular list of log directories wraps around.
#
#  Once stone has been started on a repository with
#      STN_TRAN_FULL_LOGGING = TRUE, then the TRUE state
#  will persist in the repository and subsequent changes to this parameter
#  in the config file will be ignored.  To change the repository back to
#  partial logging you must do a full backup and then restore the backup into
#  a copy of $GEMSTONE/bin/extent0.dbf .
#
# Default: NONE, a value must be provided.
# A value for this option is provided at the end of this file.

#=========================================================================
# STN_TRAN_LOG_DIRECTORIES
#   List of directories or raw disk partitions used for transaction
#   logging.  This list defines the maximum number of log files that will
#   be on-line at once.
#
#   An individual raw Unix disk partition may only occur once in this list.
#   A directory may occur multiple times, if the file system containing the
#   directory contains enough space for multiple logs .
#
#   This list must contain at least two entries.
#
#   On UNIX systems, the null device /dev/null may be specified to prevent
#   tranlogs from being written.
#
#   EXTREME CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN OPERATING THE REPOSITORY IN THIS MODE!!
#
#   If the system crashes while operating in this mode, all
#   transactions after the last completed checkpoint will be
#   lost.
#
# Default: NONE
# A value for this option is provided at the end of this file.

#=========================================================================
# STN_TRAN_LOG_SIZES
#   Maximum size of log files, must have same number of elements as
#   STN_TRAN_LOG_DIRECTORIES.
#  Units: Megabytes , Min: 3, Max: 16384     (1 Megabyte = 1048576 bytes) .
#  This list must contain at least two entries.
# Default: NONE
# Recommended value >= 100 .
# A value for this option is provided at the end of this file.
